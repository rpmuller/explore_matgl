# Explore the matgl interatomic poteential
You will modify a python script to explore the matgl interatomic potential.

- Use uv to manage the python environment
- Keep code updated with a local git repository.
- Create a github repo under my id rpmuller called "explore_matgl" and push changes to this repo.
- There is a preliminary script @explore_matgl.py in this folder. Convert it to a jupyter notebook. 
- create a 3Dmol.js viewer for the resulting structure
- Expand this notebook into a tutorial to learn more about matgl. This appears to be a very useful platform for running molecular dynamics in Python. Keep this short, something I can explore in 10 minutes to get a high-level overview.
